# What
A model I made to mount my Logitech Z333 speakers on top of my Samsung CR49RG90 monitor

## Files
* `Samsung-CR49RG90_Logitech_Z333.f3d` <- Original. Designer file from Autodesk Fusion 360.
* `Samsung-CR49RG90_Logitech-Z333.3mf` <- Exported model to a more common format. Should fit the left side of the screen.
* `Samsung-CR49RG90_Logitech-Z333-speaker_left.stl` <- Same file exported to STL
* `Samsung-CR49RG90_Logitech-Z333-speaker_right.stl` <- Same file but flipped to fit right side

# Why
My monitor is too wide to have the speakers on the side, and I want to have it too low to have the speakers below. And I don't want them to block the screen by having them infront either. They are not heavy, so I figured I could place them on top.

The model is made specifically for for this monitor, and it's been a trial and error approach to get something that _almost_ fits.

# How
Made in Autodesk Fusion 360. Also used this to learn Autodesk Fusion 360, so probably did all the rookie mistakes possible.

The fit for the curve on the back of the monitor was trial and error.

# Issues
- It's not a 100% fit with the monitor, but it's pretty close.
- Bit hard to print after I tried to be clever and use less material

First I just made the top part just a square, then I thought I should be clever and try to save material by making it match my speakers. But it turns out that just require almost as much material in support, and results in a much harder print.

I don't have the models for the old version anymore, but I guess it's possible to backtrack in the .f3d-file.

# Disclaimer
This is my first model ever made ðŸ˜®

I'd love to hear if anyone have any use of it.

Do whatever you want with it.

# Pictures
Printed on Creality CR-6 SE with black PLA and lots of support. Not sure about the details there, but had to use a few attempts to get it right.
